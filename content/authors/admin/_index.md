**Hi and welcome to my website!** 

My name is William and I am a second-year master's student in Life Science engineering at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/life-sciences-engineering/) .

I'm currently working as a research intern at [SUN bioscience](https://sunbioscience.ch/), where I am helping in the development of an *in vitro* model of liver cancer using the [Gri3D platform](https://sunbioscience.ch/technology/). 

My main research interest lies in the development of reliable *in vitro* models for the study and treatment of complex diseases such as cancer and Parkinson's disease. Not only would such models help in the treatment of patients, but I also dare to hope that they would one day completely replace the use of animals in research.
